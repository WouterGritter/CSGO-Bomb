# CSGO-Bomb
The Arduino (ESP) code for my (fake!) CS:GO bomb hardware simulation.

# How I made the bomb
I've written a couple of blog posts to entertain you with the process I went through of making the bomb.

"Part 2": https://blog.woutergritter.me/2020/07/22/wrapping-up-the-csgo-bomb-project/

If you are interested in how I managed to get the exact beep pattern of the bomb, and how you can use it yourself, check out this post!

Spoiler: It wasn't as easy as googling "csgo bomb beep pattern"..
